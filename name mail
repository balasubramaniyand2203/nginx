Resignation Discussion – Compensation Review Request

As communicated, I have submitted my resignation and have received an offer of 10 LPA, with another opportunity of 12 LPA currently in progress.

Considering my 5.2 years of experience, current responsibilities, and prevailing market standards, I believe my current compensation does not align with industry standards. Due to financial commitments and career growth considerations, I am seeking improved compensation.

I have also recently completed the Azure AZ-104 certification as part of my continuous skill enhancement and professional development.

If the organization is willing to match 10 LPA, I would be happy to withdraw my resignation and continue my services.

Additionally, I request an early release within 30 days. I am willing to opt for the buyout option if required. All my deliverables are on track, and knowledge transfer has been completed. If needed, I am ready to provide additional KT support to the developers to ensure a smooth transition.

Kindly share your decision at the earliest. I look forward to your response.
